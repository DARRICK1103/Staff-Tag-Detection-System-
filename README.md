# Staff Tag Detection System

This project performs automated detection of staff members in video footage using a two-stage YOLOv8-based pipeline. It first detects humans, then classifies whether a staff tag is present via a second model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- YOLOv8-based person detection (`yolo12s.pt`)
- Staff tag detection via secondary model (`best.pt`)
- Confidence-based tag verification
- Historical tracking to reduce false positives
- Staff image cropping and saving to folder
- Video output with annotations
- Dataset preprocessing and visualization
